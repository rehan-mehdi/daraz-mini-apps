## Nuxt JS
Nuxt JS is the framework built on top of Vue JS to facilitate app development.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
# The port will be obtained from server object in nuxt.config.js file
# In our case the port is set to 8000
# You can change it as per your needs
$ npm run dev

# The following versions of npm and node were used at the time of development

# npm --version
6.14.11
