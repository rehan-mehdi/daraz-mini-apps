# Missions on Serverless Architecture

## Nuxt JS
Nuxt JS is the framework built on top of Vue JS to facilitate app development.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
# The port will be obtained from server object in nuxt.config.js file
# In our case the port is set to 8000
# You can change it as per your needs
$ npm run dev

# The following versions of npm and node were used at the time of development

# npm --version
6.14.11

# node --version
v14.16.0
```

## Branches
Five branches have been derived from `main` branch reflecting 5 different ventures:

1. `bd`
2. `lk`
3. `mm`
4. `np`
5. `pk`


Necessary configuration for `axios` call and `router` setting in nuxt.config.js has been done for developers.

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
